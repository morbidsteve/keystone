## Overview

KEYSTONE is a logistics intelligence web application for the United States Marine Corps, built as a component of **Project Dynamis** (USMC's CJADC2 initiative). It ingests unstructured logistics data from sources Marines already use -- mIRC chat logs, Excel spreadsheets, GCSS-MC exports, TAK servers, and manual entry -- structures that data into a canonical schema, and presents it through dashboards, automated reports, and predictive analytics at every echelon from company to MEF.

The platform is designed for both connected and **air-gapped deployments**. A built-in tile proxy supports offline map operations, containers are hardened per the DoD Container Hardening Guide, and a full static demo mode enables evaluation without any backend infrastructure. The simulator generates realistic multi-day exercise data to support training, demos, and development.

KEYSTONE tracks the complete logistics picture: supply levels across all 10 NATO supply classes, fleet-level equipment readiness aggregates, individual vehicle status with faults and maintenance history, transportation movements with convoy manifests, personnel with weapons loads, and automated alerts when thresholds are breached.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI pipeline is a **5-phase DevSecOps workflow** (`.github/workflows/dsop.yml`) triggered on pushes to `main`/`develop` and pull requests:

| Phase | Jobs | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **1. Lint** | Backend lint (ruff + mypy), Frontend lint (tsc -b) | Static analysis and type checking |
| **2. Build + Scan** | Docker image builds, Grype/Trivy CVE scans, Semgrep SAST, CodeQL | Container builds and vulnerability scanning |
| **3. Test + DAST** | Backend tests (pytest), Frontend tests (vitest), ZAP DAST | Unit tests and dynamic security testing |
| **4. Sign + Attest** | Cosign keyless signing, SBOM generation | Supply chain security |
| **5. Compliance Gate** | Final gate aggregating all prior results | All checks must pass |

A separate **Deploy to GitHub Pages** workflow builds the frontend in demo mode and publishes to `https://<org>.github.io/keystone/`.

## Offline / Air-Gapped Deployment

KEYSTONE supports deployment in disconnected environments:

1. **Tile caching**: Pre-download map tiles for your AO:
   ```bash
   python scripts/download-tiles.py \
     --bbox 33.0,-117.6,33.5,-117.0 \
     --zoom 8-14 \
     --output ./tiles \
     --source osm
   ```

2. **Tile proxy**: Nginx and Vite dev server both proxy tile requests through `/tiles/{osm,satellite,topo}`, allowing you to serve cached tiles locally.

3. **Demo mode**: Build the frontend with `VITE_DEMO_MODE=true` for a fully functional static site with no backend dependency.

4. **Container images**: All containers run as non-root with read-only filesystems, hardened per the DoD Container Hardening Guide. Images are signed with Cosign for supply chain verification.
